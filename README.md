# union-syntax-highlighter-theme

Just a compiled theme for the famous [SyntaxHighlighter](https://github.com/syntaxhighlighter) project. This is my personal "Orange Compaq II" theme I use for basically everything. Includes compiled JS/CSS/Font for marking up `<pre>` tags to look like real live code.
